            <h2>Strategies for writing clean code</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>The main principle of clean code writing</h3>
                <p>Writing clean code involves adhering to principles and practices that enhance readability, maintainability, and understandability for both the original author and future collaborators.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle:</strong> Ensure that each function, class, or module has only one well-defined responsibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Readability and Formatting:</strong> Maintain consistent formatting, indentation, and spacing throughout the codebase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Use comments to explain why a particular decision was made or why a complex piece of logic exists, rather than simply restating what the code does.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected situations and prevent crashes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Testing helps ensure that changes do not introduce regressions and provides a safety net for refactoring.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>A hike is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside.</p>
                <p>The warm sunshine on your face, the sound of the wind rushing through the trees overhead, and the soft earthy feel of the trail under your boots. Not only are these experiences enjoyable to have, but theyâ€™re good for you, too.</p>
